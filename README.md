# A-B-Test-for-an-e-commerce-website
This project was used to understand the effects of a new e-commerce webpage design on the conversion rate i.e, consumers buying a product.

## Overview
A medium-sized e-commerce business has a current conversion rate i.e., <b>consumers buying a product</b>, of <b>12%</b>, the firm wants to increase the conversion rate to <b>14%</b>. To help increase the conversion rate, the firm asks the design team to redesign their website. 

As analysts of the e-commerce firm, we need to test the effect of the new website on the conversion rate. The new design of the website will be implemented if the conversion rate rises to <b>14%</b>.
